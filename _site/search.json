The theory behind the statistical models will be reviewed with some specific emphasis on data applications using the software SAS.\nThe course will focus on regression models, including linear models, generalized linear models and models for longitudinal data with random effects and correlation structure. For each of these models, basic inference principles will be reviewed such as hypothesis testing and estimation procedures.\n\nBasic principles in inference and statistical modeling\nLinear models\nGeneralized linear models\nModels for longitudinal data and correlated data\nIntroduction to survival analysis"
